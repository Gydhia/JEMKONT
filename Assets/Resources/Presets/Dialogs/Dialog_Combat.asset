  Dialogs:
  - 'Look ahead ! A monster, the inhabitants of this island are mostly harmless but
    some of them get corrupted by the abyss !

    This one must have managed to
    get out.

    Let''s teach him a lesson !'
  - 'Walk up to the combat arena, and start the combat !

    You''ll be able to
    move, attack by dragging and dropping from your character and use your cards
    !'
  - 'Good luck kiddo, and if you feel like you''re not ready yet, you can always
    try again !

    Take your time, the island isn''t going anywhere soon! (right?)'
